1D Pong for the Micropython Pyboard and a 144-LED WS2812 strip.


Push the button when the "ball" is in your goal area. Don't let it go
past the end of the strip, or you lose a point! When all of your 10
points are gone, game over.

When you push the button close to the ent of the strip, it will go faster,
making it harder for your opponent to react.

See the `youtube video`_ for a demo.

Software
--------

Requires the `micropython-ws2812`_ library.
Copy ``ws2812.py`` from there and ``main.py`` from here to your pyboard.

If you have more or fewer than 144 LEDs in your strip, adjust ``SIZE``
at the top of ``main.py``.
